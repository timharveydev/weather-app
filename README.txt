A simple Javascript weather app. I made it so that I could practise working with APIs in JS; I've done my best to keep the code clear and concise.

The app uses the user's geolocation to determine the local weather, and the unit of measurement can be changed from Celsius to Fahrenheit by clicking on the temperature.

I intend to add a dark mode feature in the future.
